               RESTRICTED SOFTWARE EVALUATION LICENSE

THIS CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT AND RESTRICTED SOFTWARE EVALUATION
LICENSE dated as of _______________, 2001, (hereinafter referred to as
``Agreement''), is entered into between SRI International, a California
nonprofit public benefit corporation, (hereinafter referred to as

IN CONSIDERATION of the mutual covenants set forth below, the parties
hereby agree as follows:

1. SRI, in its sole discretion, shall disclose certain Confidential
Information, as defined below, to LICENSEE on the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement. The term of this Agreement shall be
six (6) months from the later date of the execution of this Agreement
(the ``Term''). However, the limitations on use and disclosure of the
Confidential Information shall survive expiration of the Term and shall
be binding upon the parties after termination of this Agreement.

2. ``Confidential Information'' shall mean, collectively, all technical,
financial and business information of any kind whatsoever, and all
tangible and intangible embodiments thereof of any kind whatsoever,
disclosed by SRI to LICENSEE or obtained by LICENSEE through observation
or examination of the foregoing, but only to the extent such information
or embodiment is maintained as confidential by SRI.  All Confidential
Information disclosed by SRI to LICENSEE shall be marked or otherwise
identified as confidential when disclosed to LICENSEE or, in the case of
information given orally, is identified as confidential in a written
document received by LICENSEE within thirty (30) days after oral
disclosure to LICENSEE.

3. The Confidential Information disclosed by SRI to LICENSEE relates to
source code, object code, documentation and examples using SRI's
technology for formal methods known as ``SAL2XML''( (hereinafter referred to
as the ``Software'').

4. The sole purpose for which SRI discloses the Confidential Information to
LICENSEE is to provide LICENSEE a limited license for internal
evaluation purposes only, of an early beta release of the Software.

5. LICENSEE shall not use any of the Confidential Information at any time
or for any purpose other than the non-commercial purpose set forth
above.

6. LICENSEE shall maintain in confidence the Confidential Information
disclosed by SRI and shall not disclose the Confidential Information to
any third party except as expressly permitted by this Agreement.
LICENSEE shall only disclose the Confidential Information to those of
its directors, officers, employees or agents having a need to know, as
reasonably necessary to facilitate the above purpose(s), provided that
such persons are obligated in writing or otherwise bound by fiduciary
obligations to LICENSEE to maintain in confidence and not use the
Confidential Information except as permitted by this Agreement.

7. LICENSEE shall promptly notify SRI upon discovery of any unauthorized
use or disclosure of SRI's Confidential Information.

8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) LICENSEE shall have the right to
disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable
law or regulation, provided that, LICENSEE shall give SRI prompt written
notice and sufficient opportunity to object to such use or disclosure,
or to request confidential treatment of the Confidential Information;
and (ii) LICENSEE's nonuse and nondisclosure obligations above shall not
apply to such Confidential Information as LICENSEE can establish by
written documentation to have been:

  a. public knowledge at the time of such disclosure by LICENSEE, or
     thereafter to have become public knowledge, other than as a result of
     acts attributable to LICENSEE in violation hereof; or

  b. rightfully known by LICENSEE (as shown by its written records) prior to
     the date of disclosure to it by SRI; or

  c. disclosed to LICENSEE on an unrestricted basis from a third party not
     under a duty of confidentiality to SRI; or

  d. independently developed by employees or agents of LICENSEE without
     access to or use of the Confidential Information.

9. Within thirty (30) days after termination of the Term, LICENSEE promptly
shall return all tangible items relating to the Confidential
Information, including all written material, photographs, models,
compounds, compositions and the like, made available or supplied by SRI
to LICENSEE, and all copies thereof; provided, however, that LICENSEE
may retain one (1) copy for its legal files.  Upon the request of SRI,
LICENSEE shall identify those persons to whom any of the Confidential
Information was disclosed.

10. SRI hereby grants LICENSEE a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
royalty-free, limited license to use the Software solely for purposes of
internal evaluation, for the Term set forth above and subject to all
terms and conditions of this Agreement.  No other rights are granted or
implied.  By way of illustration only, no right is granted: (a) to copy
the Software, except to the limited extent that transient copies of
executable code are automatically created in the course of normal
execution, (b) to modify or make any derivative works based upon the
Software, (c) to sell, rent, license or in any way distribute or
transfer the Software or products and services based upon the Software.

11. LICENSEE acknowledges that the Software and the results obtained from
any evaluation or benchmark testing conducted pursuant to this Agreement
embody valuable information proprietary to SRI (Confidential
Information) protected by this Agreement.

12. This Agreement shall not be construed to grant any license or other
rights except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

13. LICENSEE may not assign this Agreement, whether by operation of law or
otherwise, without the prior express written consent of SRI.  Any
purported assignment in violation of this section shall be null and
void.

14. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of law
principles thereof.

15. Each party hereby acknowledges that the rights and obligations of this
Agreement are subject to the laws and regulations of the United States
relating to the export of products and technical information.  Without
limitation, each party shall comply with all such laws and regulations.

16. SRI makes no representations or warranties express or implied of any
type whatsoever regarding the Confidential Information, including
without limitation noninfringement, merchantability or fitness for any
particular purpose.  LICENSEE's use of the Confidential Information
shall be at LICENSEE's own risk, and SRI assumes no liability or
obligation to LICENSEE as a result thereof.

17. This Agreement shall be binding upon and for the benefit of the
undersigned parties, their successors and assigns.  Failure to enforce
any provisions of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any
term hereof.

18. This Agreement embodies the entire understanding between the parties and
supersedes any prior understanding and agreements between and among them
respecting the subject matter hereof.  There are no representations,
agreements, arrangements or understandings, oral or written, between the
parties hereto relating to the subject matter of this Agreement which
are not fully expressed herein.  No change, modification, extension,
termination or waiver of this Agreement, or any of the provisions herein
contained, shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by duly
authorized representatives of the parties hereto.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties through their duly authorized
representatives have entered into this Agreement as of the date first
written above.
