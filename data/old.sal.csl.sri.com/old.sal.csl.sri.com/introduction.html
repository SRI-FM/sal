<h1>Introduction</h1>

<hr noshade>

SAL stands for Symbolic Analysis Laboratory.  It is a framework for
combining different tools for abstraction, program analysis, theorem
proving, and model checking toward the calculation of properties (symbolic
analysis) of transition systems.  A key part of the SAL framework is an
intermediate language for describing transition systems.  This language
serves as the <i>target</i> for translators that extract the transition
system description for popular programming languages such as Esterel,
Java, and Statecharts.  The intermediate language also serves as a common
<i>source</i> for driving different analysis tools through translators
from the intermediate language to the input format for the tools, and from
the output of these tools back to the SAL intermediate language.
<p>

The SAL intermediate language is not that different from the input languages 
used by various other verification tools such as
<a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~modelcheck/smv.html">SMV</a>,
<a href="http://verify.stanford.edu/dill/murphi.html">Murphi</a>,
<a href="http://www-cad.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mocha/"> Mocha</a>,
and
<a href="http://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html">SPIN</a>.
Like these languages, SAL describes transition systems in terms of
initialization and transition commands.  These can be given by
variable-wise definitions in the style of <a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~modelcheck/smv.html">SMV</a>
or as guarded commands in
the style of <a href="http://verify.stanford.edu/dill/murphi.html">Murphi</a>.  
<p>

The SAL 2.1 distribution includes: symbolic and witness model checkers, bounded
model checkers (finite and infinite systems), interactive simulator, and a well-formedness checker.
