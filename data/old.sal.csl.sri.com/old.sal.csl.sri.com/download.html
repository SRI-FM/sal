SAL Version 2.2 (released 23 Apr 2004)
</h2>
<p>
SAL is free for noncommercial research purposes, but requires
registration and acceptance of its licensing terms.    
<p>
SAL 2.2 includes SALenv 2.2 (symbolic, witness, bounded,
and infinite-bounded model checkers, and related tools), and ICS 2.0b.

   <ul>
   <li><a href=sal-2.2-binaries.html>Binary Distributions</a>.  This is what most
           users will need.  Distributions are available for Linux,
           Solaris, Mac OS X, and Cygwin.  After clicking the link,
           you will be able to download, but to activate your copy of
           SAL you will need to register by filling in a simple online
           form that will automatically generate a license certificate
           and email it to you.

   </li>

   <li><a href=sal-2.2-sources.html>Source Distribution</a>.  This
   link is password protected.  The source
   distribution requires the <a href=fm-license.pdf>SRI FM license</a>
   to be printed, signed, and returned to SRI for processing.  You
   will then receive a login and password.

<h3>Older Versions</h3>

<h3>
<a href=sal-2.1.html>SAL 2.1</a> (released 24 Jan 2004)
</h3> 

SAL 2.1 includes SALenv 2.1 (symbolic, witness, bounded, and infinite-bounded
model checkers, and related tools), and ICS 2.0.  

<h3>
<a href=sal-2.0.html>SAL 2.0</a> (released 12 Nov 2003)
</h3> 

SAL 2.0 includes SAL2XML 2.0 (parser), SALenv 2.0 (symbolic, bounded,
and infinite-bounded model checkers, and related tools), and ICS 2.0.
Note that unlike SAL 2.1, this version of SAL2XML requires Java.

<h3>
<a href=sal-1.0.html>SAL 1.0</a> (released June 2002)
</h3> 

Note that this requires the same license as the source distribution described above. <p>

SAL 1.0 provides an explicit-state model checker and related tools.
It uses a slightly older version of the SAL language (see the
<tt>sal.dtd</tt> file in the tar file).  Explicit-state model checking
is very useful in certain circumstances and SAL users who require this
capability currently must use SAL 1.0.  We do plan to port the SAL
explicit-state model checker to SAL 2.X in the future.  SAL 1.0 and
SAL 2.0 can coexist.
