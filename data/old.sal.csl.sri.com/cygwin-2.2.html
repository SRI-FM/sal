<h1>SAL 2.2 Cygwin Installation</h1>

<hr noshade>


Cygwin is a Unix-like environment that runs on Windows.   If you want
to use SAL in Windows, you must first install Cygwin.   For Windows
XP, this goes as follows (please send us corrections for other
versions of Windows):
<p>
Go to <a
href=http://www.cygwin.com/>www.cygwin.com/</a>:
<ol>
<li> Click on the <tt>Install or update now!</tt> button
<li> This will request permission to open the file <tt>setup.exe</tt>
<li> The next screens ask some questions.   You want to <tt>Install
From The Internet</tt> and may as well accept the default root
directory <tt>c:\cygwin</tt> and <tt>Install For All
Users</tt>.   If you want to use Windows editors to prepare and edit SAL files,
then change the <tt>Default Text File Type</tt> to <tt>DOS</tt>.
<li>The next couple of screens ask how you connect to the internet, and
then you are asked to choose  a download site; pick one near you (from
the USA, the University of Delaware site seems fast and reliable).
<li><tt>setup.exe</tt> will be downloaded and opened and the next
screen will ask you to select packages.   You can just click on
the next button to install the default configuration, but
<ul>
<li>If you have no interest in Cygwin other than to run SAL, you can
save download time and file space by deselecting XFree86,
<li>If you want to prepare and edit SAL files with a Unix editor,
select your favorite editor (e.g., ed, vi, or emacs) from  the Editors entry.
</ul>
<li>The default installation takes about 15 minutes to download over a
DSL connection, and another 5 minutes to build and install itself.
<li>You should now be able to start Cygwin (it puts an icon on the
desktop by default).  You will see a tty-like window.  Type
<tt>pwd</tt> -- this will tell you the current directory in Cygwin
terms.   It should be something like <tt>/home/foo</tt> where
<tt>foo</tt> is your Windows user name.   This Cygwin directory will
correspond to the Windows directory <tt>c:\cygwin\home\foo</tt>.
<li>From Windows, download the
<a href=http://sal.csl.sri.com/download-binaries/sal-2.2-bin-i686-pc-cygwin.tar.gz>SAL for Cygwin</a> file into this directory.
<li>In Cygwin, type <tt>tar xzf sal-2.2-bin-i686-pc-cygwin.tar.gz</tt>
(the tab key provides completion, and the filename will change with
different versions of SAL).
<li>Then type <tt>cd sal-2.2</tt> (or whatever the current version is)
and then <tt>./install.sh</tt>
<li>Next, in Windows, copy the license file that was mailed to you to a directory
<tt>somewhere</tt> under <tt>c:\cygwin\home\foo</tt>.
<li>Using a Unix editor, edit the file <tt>.bashrc</tt>, or with a
Windows editor, the file <tt>c:\cygwin\home\foo\.bashrc</tt>, and
append the following lines
<pre>
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/sal-2.2/bin
SAL_LICENSE_CERTIFICATE=$HOME/somewhere/certificate
export SAL_LICENSE_CERTIFICATE
ICS_LICENSE_CERTIFICATE=$HOME/somewhere/certificate
export ICS_LICENSE_CERTIFICATE
SALPATH=.:/$HOME/somewhere-else
export SALPATH
</pre>
where <tt>somewhere-else</tt> is the name of the directory where you
intend to keep SAL files (use a colon-separated list if there is more
than one of them; the dot at the front ensures SAL will always look in the
current directory first).
<li>Finally, exit Cygwin and start it again and SAL should run
nicely (try typing <tt>sal-smc --help</tt>).
</ol>
