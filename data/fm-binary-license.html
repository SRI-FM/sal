<h3>GRANT</h3> SRI International ("SRI") hereby grants to you a
royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, limited
license under the Licensed IP to use the software programs set forth in
Exhibit A attached hereto in object code format ("Software") and related
documentation ("Documentation") upon the terms and conditions set forth
below:<p>

<h3>DEFINITIONS</h3>

"License Agreement" means this document.<p>

"Licensed IP" means all patent claims, trade secrets and copyrights
freely licensable by SRI that are embodied in or necessarily practiced by
the use of the Software or Documentation.<p>

"Non-Commercial Purposes" means use of the Software and Documentation
solely for non-commercial research purposes in exchange for which no
financially valuable consideration (including, without limitation, sales
or license revenue, service revenue, and advertising revenue, and whether
in the form of monetary, equity, or other forms of consideration) is
received, except for research funding received from an official government
agency sponsor, a non-profit foundation, or similar research funding
organization.<p>

<h3>USAGE</h3>

<strong>Licensee may:</strong> (a) use or copy the Software and
Documentation solely for Non-Commercial Purposes; (b) modify the Software
or create derivative works thereof solely for internal use by Licensee
only; (c) create interfaces to the Software in larger applications.<p>

<strong>All other uses, including, without limitation,</strong> publishing,
distributing, or transferring copies of the Software, or modifications
thereto, and Documentation to any third party, either in part, in whole,
or as a component of larger applications and making interfaces to the
Software available on a public network are strictly prohibited.  These
examples are by way of illustration, not limitation; except as expressly
set forth above (under "Licensee may"), no other license rights are implied
or otherwise granted under this License Agreement.<p>

If Licensee provides any derivative works of the Software or Documentation
(including without limitation bug fixes and enhancements) to SRI, Licensee
grants SRI a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-revocable license
to modify, copy, use and distribute said derivative works.<p>

<h3>TITLE</h3> SRI retains title, exclusive ownership rights, and
intellectual property rights, including without limitation, all trade
secrets, patents, trademarks, and copyrights, in and to the Software and
Documentation.  The Software and Documentation are protected by the
copyright laws of the United States and international copyright treaties.
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to Licensee
under and intellectual property rights of SRI, except as expressly set
forth herein.<p>

<h3>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY</h3> THE LICENSED IP IS A RESEARCH TOOL
STILL IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE AND IS PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE.  THE
SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED ON AS "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, THAT THE LICENSED IP IS FREE OF DEFECTS, OR
THAT THE USE OF THE LICENSED IP WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS,
TRADEMARKS, OR OTHER RIGHTS OF ANY THIRD PARTY.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED IP IS BORNE BY LICENSEE.  SHOULD
THE LICENSED IP PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, LICENSEE AND NOT SRI
ASSUMES THE ENTIRE COST OF ANY SERVICES AND REPAIR.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT.<p>


<h3>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER
NO LEGAL THEORY, TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL SRI OR ITS
AFFILIATES, SRI'S AGENTS, OFFICERS, ASSISTANTS AND EMPLOYEES EITHER IN
THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES OR BY REASON OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO SRI AND
SRI'S SUCCESSORS, BE HELD LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SRI SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  IN NO EVENT SHALL SRI BE LIABLE FOR COSTS OF
PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE OR REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.  THIS
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE.<p>

<h3>NO SUPPORT, NO UPDATES</h3> This license does not grant
Licensee any right to any software support, enhancements or updates.<p>

<h3>TERMINATION</h3> This license will terminate automatically if
Licensee fails to comply with the limitations described above.  On
termination, Licensee must destroy all copies of the Software and
Documentation.<p>

<h3>EXPORT RESTRICTIONS</h3> Each party hereby acknowledges that the
rights and obligations of this License Agreement are subject to the laws and
regulations of the United States relating to the export of products and
technical information.  Without limitation, each party shall comply with
all such applicable laws and regulations.<p>

<h3>U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS</h3> If the Software or any
accompanying Documentation is used or acquired by or on behalf of any
unit, division or agency of the United States Government, this provision
applies.  The Software and any accompanying Documentation is provided with
RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  The use, modification, reproduction, release, display,
duplication or disclosure thereof by or on behalf of any unit, division or
agency of the Government is subject to the restrictions set forth in
subdivision (c)(1) of the Commercial Computer Software-Restricted Rights
clause at 48 CFR 52.227-19 and the restrictions set forth in the Rights in
Technical Data-Non-commercial Items clause set forth in 48 CFR

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS</h3> This License Agreement represents the
complete agreement concerning this license between the parties and
supersedes all prior agreement and representations between them.  It may
be amended only by a writing executed by both parties.  If any provision
of this License Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable.  This License Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to the
conflicts of law principles thereof, and shall not be governed by the
United Nations convention on contracts for the international sale of
goods.<p>

<h3>LICENSEE WARRANTY</h3>

LICENSEE WARRANTS THAT THEY HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT, AND THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THE
LICENSED IP IS OF A COMMERCIALLY VALUABLE NATURE AND THAT SIGNIFICANT HARM
WILL ARISE TO SRI DUE TO ANY BREACH OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT BY LICENSEE.

<h3>END-USE STATEMENT</h3>

Use of the Licensed IP outside the USA may be subject to US Government
export licensing requirements.  The requirements are dependent on the use
to be made of the Licensed IP.  Overseas users must therefore submit
with their completed license a statement of the end-use to which they plan
to put the Software.<p>

If it applies to your use of the Licensed IP, we suggest you
use the following form of words:<p>

<i>The Licensed IP will be used to conduct basic and applied research.  It is
intended that the results of the research will be made generally
available, and published should they merit it.</i><p>

If your use of the Licensed IP will concern something other than research,
or if the results will be restricted for proprietary or national security
reasons, then please provide explicit details in your end-use statement.
